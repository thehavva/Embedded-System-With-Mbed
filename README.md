**What is Mbed?**<br/>
Mbed is a platform and operating system for internet-connected devices based on 32-bit ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. Such devices are also known as Internet of Things devices. The project is collaboratively developed by Arm and its technology partners.<br/>

**Applications**<br/>
Applications for the Mbed platform can be developed using the Mbed online IDE, a free online code editor and compiler. Only a web browser needs to be installed on the local PC, since a project is compiled on the cloud, i.e. on a remote server, using the ARMCC C/C++ compiler. The Mbed IDE provides private workspaces with ability to import, export, and share code with distributed Mercurial version control, and it can be used also for code documentation generation. Applications can be developed also with other development environments such as Keil ÂµVision, IAR Embedded Workbench, and Eclipse with GCC ARM Embedded tools.
Today also Mbed Simulator is used, which offers users make projects or write some codes without electronic card. In this repository, I will write my codes with Mbed simulator although some of properties of Arm-Mbed, it will be easy our life while learning embedded sytem.<br/>
